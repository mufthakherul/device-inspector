# Security Policy

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please notify the maintainers privately:
- Contact: @mufthakherul on GitHub

Do NOT create a public issue for security-sensitive reports.

Process
1. Create a private communication with the maintainer describing the issue, proof of concept, and steps to reproduce.
2. We will acknowledge within 72 hours and publish a coordinated disclosure timeline where appropriate.

Dependencies and CVE handling will be documented later as the codebase grows.
