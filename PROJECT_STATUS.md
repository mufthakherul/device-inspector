## Comparison to Roadmap Targets

### Phase 1 Target (Weeks 1-6): MVP Quick-mode Agent

**Original Scope:**
- Agent skeleton ✅ Done
- Inventory & SMART ✅ Done (100%)
- Disk performance 🔴 Not started (Sprint 2)
- Battery parsing 🔴 Not started (Sprint 2)
- CPU benchmark 🔴 Not started (Sprint 2)
- Scoring engine ⚠️ Partial (40%)
- report.json & PDF ⚠️ JSON done, PDF Sprint 3

**Timeline Assessment:**
- **Ahead of schedule on Sprint 1** — Completed in 1 day instead of 2 weeks
- **Ready for Sprint 2** — Solid foundation with working inventory and SMART
- **Recommendation:** Begin Sprint 2 features (fio, battery, CPU) immediately

---

## Recommendations for Next Phase

### For Project Maintainer (@mufthakherul)

1. **🎉 Sprint 1 Complete!**
   - Celebrate the achievement — all three priorities done ahead of schedule
   - Inventory, SMART execution, and error handling fully implemented
   - 22 tests passing with good coverage

2. **Begin Sprint 2 Implementation**
   - Start with fio disk performance integration
   - Add battery health detection (upower)
   - Implement CPU benchmarking (sysbench)
   - Complete scoring engine for all categories

3. **Maintain Quality Standards**
   - Continue writing tests for new features
   - Keep coverage above 45% (target 60%)
   - Document new features in README

4. **Track Progress**
   - Update PROJECT_STATUS.md after Sprint 2
   - Add achievements to CHANGELOG.md
   - Keep ROADMAP.md current

### For Contributors (Future)

When the project is ready for contributions:

1. Start with well-defined issues from ROADMAP sprints
2. Follow CONTRIBUTING.md guidelines strictly
3. Focus on one plugin at a time (e.g., battery, CPU)
4. Write tests first (TDD approach recommended)
5. Use sample outputs from `/samples` for parser tests
