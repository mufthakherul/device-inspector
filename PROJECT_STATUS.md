## Blockers & Risks

### Current Blockers

1. **No Active Development Resources** — Project needs dedicated development time
2. **Hardware Testing Requirements** — Need physical devices for realistic testing
3. **Native Tool Dependencies** — Require smartctl, fio, memtester, etc. for full testing

### Active Risks

| Risk | Severity | Status | Mitigation |
|------|----------|--------|------------|
| **Platform Fragmentation** | High | 🟡 Monitoring | Linux-first approach, document Windows/macOS limits |
| **Hardware Heterogeneity** | High | 🟡 Monitoring | Graceful degradation, comprehensive error handling |
| **License Limits Adoption** | Medium | 🟡 Monitoring | Clear commercial licensing path in docs |
| **False Positives/Negatives** | High | 🟡 Monitoring | Include raw logs, clear disclaimers |
| **Security Vulnerabilities** | Medium | 🟢 Mitigated | Security policy in place, will add scanning |
| **Scope Creep** | Medium | 🟢 Mitigated | Clear MVP definition in docs |

## Comparison to Roadmap Targets

### Phase 1 Target (Weeks 1-6): MVP Quick-mode Agent

**Original Scope:**
- Agent skeleton ✅ Done
- Inventory & SMART ⚠️ Partial (30%)
- Disk performance 🔴 Not started
- Battery parsing 🔴 Not started
- CPU benchmark 🔴 Not started
- Scoring engine ⚠️ Partial (40%)
- report.json & PDF 🔴 PDF not started

**Timeline Assessment:**
- **Behind schedule** — Should be in Sprint 2, currently in Sprint 1
- **Recommendation:** Need focused development sprint to catch up
- **Mitigation:** Excellent documentation provides clear implementation path

---

## Recommendations for Next Phase

### For Project Maintainer (@mufthakherul)

1. **Prioritize Sprint 1 Completion**
   - Focus on inventory plugin completion
   - Complete real SMART execution (not just parsing)
   - Add comprehensive error handling

2. **Expand Test Coverage**
   - Target 60%+ code coverage
   - Add integration tests with mocked tools
   - Set up coverage reporting in CI

3. **Begin Sprint 2 Planning**
   - Create issues for fio, upower, sysbench integrations
   - Define test cases for each new feature
   - Plan scoring engine completion

4. **Consider Community Engagement**
   - Create "good first issue" tickets from ROADMAP
   - Write dev setup guide beyond CONTRIBUTING.md
   - Consider adding architecture diagrams

### For Contributors (Future)

When the project is ready for contributions:

1. Start with well-defined issues from ROADMAP sprints
2. Follow CONTRIBUTING.md guidelines strictly
3. Focus on one plugin at a time (e.g., battery, CPU)
4. Write tests first (TDD approach recommended)
5. Use sample outputs from `/samples` for parser tests

---

## Appendix: Quick Stats

**Project Age:** ~2 weeks (based on initial commits)  
**Documentation:** 13 files, ~2500 lines  
**Code:** ~350 Python LOC implemented  
**Tests:** 6 passing  
**Dependencies:** 6 Python packages  
**Target Platform:** Linux (Ubuntu/Debian focus)  
**License:** Custom non-commercial  
**Estimated Completion (MVP):** 4-6 more weeks of focused development  

---

## Conclusion

**Overall Assessment:** 🟡 **Good Foundation, Early Stage Implementation**

The device-inspector project has an **excellent foundation** with comprehensive, high-quality documentation that clearly defines goals, architecture, features, and implementation roadmap. The documentation alone represents significant planning work and provides a clear path forward.

However, the **implementation is in early stages** (~15% complete) with only the basic agent skeleton and SMART parsing functionality implemented. To meet the ambitious MVP goals outlined in the roadmap, the project needs:

1. **Focused development time** to implement remaining plugins
2. **Hardware testing capability** for realistic validation
3. **Community engagement** to scale development (optional)

The project is **well-positioned for success** given:
- Clear technical direction
- Comprehensive specifications
- Working CI/CD pipeline
- Clean code architecture
- Active security considerations

**Recommendation:** Continue with Sprint 1 completion focusing on inventory and SMART execution, then proceed systematically through the roadmap sprints. The documentation quality ensures any developer can pick up and implement features with confidence.

---

**Status Report Generated:** 2025-10-28  
**Next Update Recommended:** After Sprint 1 completion or 2 weeks (whichever comes first)
