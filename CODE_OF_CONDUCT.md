# Code of Conduct — device-inspector (inspecta)

Last updated: 2025-10-18

This Code of Conduct sets expectations for behavior in the device-inspector (inspecta) project and describes how the project will respond to unacceptable behavior. Our goal is to make this project a welcoming, respectful, and productive place for contributors and users from all backgrounds.

If you are reporting a violation or need help, see the "Reporting & Enforcement" section below.

---

## 1. Purpose

device-inspector (inspecta) exists to produce a trustworthy, privacy-conscious tool for evaluating used laptops and PCs. We depend on an inclusive, respectful community to build, test, document, and operate the project. This Code of Conduct helps make participation safe and productive for everyone.

This Code:
- Defines acceptable and unacceptable behaviors.
- Explains how to report problems and how reports will be handled.
- Explains enforcement options and appeals.
- States expectations for maintainers and contributors.

---

## 2. Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all project spaces and activities, including but not limited to:
- GitHub repository issues, pull requests, comments, and code.
- The project's chat rooms, discussion forums, mailing lists, and social media.
- Project events, meetups, and conference participation (virtual and in-person) where attendees are present as representatives of the project.
- Third-party services and integrations that are used by the project or hosted under the project's name.

All people participating in the project are expected to follow this Code.

---

## 3. Our Standards (What We Expect)

We expect participants to:
- Be welcoming, friendly, patient, and collegial.
- Treat others with respect and consideration; appreciate that people have different perspectives and lived experiences.
- Assume good faith when interacting with others.
- Provide constructive feedback and refrain from personal attacks.
- Use inclusive language and avoid profanity, slurs, or demeaning comments.
- Respect privacy: do not post or request private data (credentials, personal documents, or test artifacts containing PII) in public channels.
- Follow contribution processes and licensing rules described in the repository (e.g., LICENSE.txt, CONTRIBUTING.md).

Examples of positive behaviors:
- Asking clarifying questions before proposing changes.
- Submitting a reproducible bug report with logs (redacted of personal data) and steps to reproduce.
- Proposing design alternatives with rationales and tradeoffs.
- Helping new contributors get set up and reviewing their first PRs patiently.

---

## 4. Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behaviors include, but are not limited to:
- Violence, threats of violence, or language that encourages violence.
- Harassment, intimidation, stalking, or deliberate exclusion.
- Derogatory or demeaning comments about a person or group (race, ethnicity, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, religion, disability, age, socio-economic status, etc.).
- Sexual harassment or unwanted sexual attention.
- Deliberate doxxing, sharing private information, or exposing PII.
- Trolling, name-calling, or insulting comments.
- Sustained disruption of project collaboration, including spamming, repeated off-topic messaging, or coordinated downvoting/brigading.
- Attempts to coerce or force maintainers to accept code or change policy through harassment.
- Use of the project content or brand in violation of the project's license, including presenting the project as a commercial product without a commercial license.
- Any behavior that violates applicable laws (copyright infringement, export control evasion, sanctions violations, etc.).

If you are unsure whether a behavior violates this Code, err on the side of respectful communication or report the behavior privately (see Reporting & Enforcement).

---

## 5. Examples (Concrete)

These examples are illustrative, not exhaustive.

Behaviors that may be reported:
- Posting “You are incompetent” in a PR review.
- Repeatedly pinging maintainers for an immediate merge and using abusive language when not done.
- Posting a screenshot with a user’s personal files or identifying information.
- Re-licensing or repackaging the project and offering it for sale without a commercial license.

Behaviors that are acceptable:
- “I think this approach may cause problem X because… Here is an alternative.”
- “I’m new to the project and having trouble running the tests; can someone point me to the right docs?”
- “I disagree — here are objective benchmarks and tradeoffs.”

---

## 6. Reporting & Enforcement

We encourage people experiencing or witnessing unacceptable behavior to report it.

How to report
1. Preferred route: Open a private communication via the repository's Security contact (see SECURITY.md) or send a direct message to a maintainer. Include:
   - A concise description of the incident.
   - Links to relevant messages, PRs, issues, or screenshots (redact private data).
   - The usernames of participants involved and the time(s) (UTC).
   - Whether you feel safe and whether you want confidentiality.
2. If you cannot use the private channel, you may open an issue with the label "confidential" only if the repository's issue tracker supports private issues (most public GitHub repos do not). Avoid posting private or identifying information publicly.

What happens after you report
- Acknowledgement: We will acknowledge receipt within 72 hours whenever possible.
- Initial review: The maintainers or a designated moderation team will review the report to determine the severity and whether immediate action is necessary.
- Actions: May include private warnings, temporary or permanent suspension from the project, removal of content (with clear reasoning), requirement to retract or revise contributions, or referral to platform enforcement (GitHub) or legal authorities for severe violations.
- Confidentiality: We will respect confidentiality requests to the extent reasonable; however, the maintainers may need to disclose limited factual details internally to properly investigate. Reporters will be kept informed about the status of the investigation subject to privacy and legal constraints.

Emergency / Law Enforcement
- If an incident involves a real-world safety threat, death threats, sexual assault, or exploitation of minors, the maintainer team may disclose information to law enforcement; we will inform the reporter when we do so where feasible.

Retaliation is prohibited
- Retaliation against anyone who reports a Code of Conduct violation in good faith is itself a violation and will be treated seriously.

## 7. Moderation Process & Enforcement Levels

Moderation will be proportionate, consistent, and documented.

Possible enforcement steps (non-exhaustive)
- Private, informal warning — for minor or first-time offenses.
- Public warning — with guidance on remedial behavior.
- Temporary restrictions — suspending commenting/PRs from an account for a limited time.
- Content removal — deleting or asking to remove offensive comments or posts.
- Permanent ban — removal from project collaboration and, where possible, blocking from project channels.
- Legal action — reserved for extreme cases (threats, copyright infringement, criminal activity).

Factors considered when determining action:
- Severity of behavior.
- Whether it was a one-time incident or repeated.
- Demonstrated remorse or willingness to correct behavior.
- Impact on victims and the community.
- Whether the person has a history of misconduct in this or other projects.

Appeals
- A person subject to enforcement decisions may request an appeal by contacting the maintainers in writing. The appeal will be reviewed by at least two maintainers who were not involved in the original decision. The appeal process aims to be fair and transparent; final decisions rest with the project owner/lead maintainer.

---

## 8. Moderation Team & Maintainer Responsibilities

Maintainers and moderators agree to:
- Apply the Code of Conduct fairly and consistently.
- Recuse themselves from investigations where they have a conflict of interest.
- Protect confidentiality as much as possible.
- Document decisions and rationale in internal records (not public unless needed).
- Communicate clearly and promptly with reporters and involved parties.
- Maintain a transparent escalation and appeal path.
- Treat all participants with respect, including those subject to enforcement.

If you are a maintainer, you must:
- Familiarize yourself with this Code.
- Respond to reports within the stated timeframes.
- Work with other maintainers to reach decisions when possible.

---

## 9. Anonymous and Third-Party Reports

Anonymous reports: We will accept and review anonymous reports, but anonymity can make investigation and remedial action more difficult. If you can provide a contact method (even an anonymous email), it may help speed investigation and resolution.

Third-party reports: Reports about another person’s behavior will be treated with the same care as first-hand reports. We may ask the reporter to confirm facts or share evidence.

---

## 10. Privacy & Data Handling

When you report or when we collect information as part of investigating a report, we will:
- Collect only information reasonably necessary to investigate.
- Limit sharing internally to those needed to investigate.
- Securely store investigation records.
- Retain records for a reasonable period to enable appeals and audits, subject to applicable law.

If you are subject to a report, you have the right to request a summary of evidence held about you. Please submit such requests via the maintainer contact in SECURITY.md.

Note: This policy is not a substitute for legal or law-enforcement action. Compliance with legal requests (subpoena, court order) may require disclosure.

---

## 11. Offline / Event Conduct

When participating in project-sponsored or affiliated events:
- Adhere to the event's Code of Conduct and this Code.
- Respect physical boundaries and the privacy of attendees.
- If you experience harassment in an event, report to event staff and the project's moderation team.

---

## 12. Licensing & Brand Use

This Code of Conduct is separate from licensing terms (see LICENSE.txt). Using the project name, logos, or the "inspecta" brand for commercial or rebranded offerings is restricted per LICENSE.txt and requires explicit permission from the Author.

---

## 13. Enforcement Outside Project-Controlled Channels

The project may not be able to directly moderate discussions on third-party platforms (e.g., social media, external forums). However:
- We may ask third-party hosts to remove offending content.
- We may block or ban users from project channels.
- We will document and, where appropriate, publicly note enforcement actions that affect project participation (without violating privacy requests).

---

## 14. Conflicts of Interest

If a maintainer or moderator has a personal or commercial relationship with a reporter, accused, or witness, they must disclose that relationship and recuse themselves from decisions related to that report.

---

## 15. Changes to This Code

The project may update this Code of Conduct over time. We will:
- Post the date of last update at the top of this document.
- Provide a short changelog in the repository when substantive changes are made.
- Allow a reasonable period (e.g., 14 days) for community feedback on non-emergency changes before they take effect when possible.

---

## 16. Acknowledgements & Adoption

This Code of Conduct adapts language and best practices from widely adopted contributor covenants and open-source projects. It is intended to be practical, enforceable, and aligned with platform policies.

---

## 17. Reporting & Contacts (summary)

Primary contact for reporting:
- Project Security & Conduct contact: see SECURITY.md
- Maintainer / project owner: @mufthakherul on GitHub

If you cannot use the repository's secure contact path, open an issue with the word "conduct" in the title and add the "conduct" label — but avoid posting sensitive personal data publicly.

---

## 18. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

Q: I saw a rude comment in a PR — should I report it?
A: Yes. Maintain polite replies and report the comment if it crosses the lines in Section 4. Include links and context when you report.

Q: What if I made a mistake and upset someone?
A: A sincere apology and corrective action are usually sufficient. Cooperate with maintainers and accept remedial steps (editing content, retraction, or other appropriate actions).

Q: Will enforcement be public?
A: Not by default. We will maintain confidentiality during investigations. In some cases (e.g., persistent bad actors), we may issue a public statement describing the action taken while limiting sensitive details.

Q: Can I report anonymously?
A: Yes, but anonymous reports make investigation harder. If safe, provide a way for maintainers to follow up (e.g., an anonymous email).
