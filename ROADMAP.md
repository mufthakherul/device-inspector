- M1: Agent skeleton + SMART + inventory + sample report â€” Sprint 1 completion
- M2: Quick-mode features + scoring + sample PDF â€” Sprint 2â€“4 completion
- M3: Viewer + optional server upload â€” Sprint 4â€“5 completion
- M4: Bootable ISO builder + memtest integration â€” Sprint 6 completion
- M5: Pilot complete and v1.0 release â€” Sprint 8 & Release

---

4) ROLES & STAFFING (recommended)
- Product Lead / PM (1): prioritization, pilot coordination, docs editorial
- Tech Lead / Architect (1): system design, CI, security sign-off
- Agent Developers (2): Python + packaging + native tool integrations
- Backend/API Developer (1): upload API, storage, basic auth
- Frontend/Viewer (1): React static viewer, UX
- QA / Test Engineer (1): CI, tests, pilot coordination
- DevOps / Build (1): ISO builder, CI/CD, release packaging
- Designer (part-time): PDF template and UX for viewer
- Legal / Privacy Advisor (consultant): license and data policy review
- Community Manager (part-time): pilot onboarding & communications

Small teams can multi-role; if contributors are limited, prioritize Agent + QA + PM.

---

5) CI / CD, QA, and TESTING STRATEGY
CI (GitHub Actions)
- Lint & static analysis on PRs
- Unit tests (fast) â€” run on each PR
- Integration tests (slow) â€” scheduled nightly or run on-demand
- Build artifacts job â€” package source dist, build ISO (on schedule)
- Release pipeline â€” sign artifacts, publish GitHub Release

Security & SCA
- Dependabot or equivalent for dependency alerts
- Secret scanning in repo & pre-commit detect-secrets
- SAST tools (bandit / ruff / mypy) included in CI

QA
- Unit coverage target: >= 65% at v1 but aim for higher
- End-to-end manual test checklist for pilot (shared as runbook)
- Regression tests for parsers and scoring engine

Pre-merge gates
- At least one approving review
- Passing unit tests & linters
- No secrets in PR

---

6) REPORTING, MONITORING & KPIs
Track the following metrics in backlog and dashboards:
- Quick-mode run success rate (per model and overall)
- Median quick-mode runtime (target â‰¤ 10 min)
- Pilot satisfaction (NPS)
- Number of signed reports generated
- CI pass rate & PR review time (median)
- Security triage time and patch lead time for critical issues

Reporting cadence
- Weekly sprint status updates: completed items, blocked items, pilot metrics
- Monthly metrics report: KPIs + community contributions + issues closed

---

7) PILOT PROGRAM & LAUNCH PLAYBOOK
Pilot objectives
- Validate agent on real devices
- Validate scoring thresholds and buyer mapping
- Validate PDF format & evidence usability for buyers
- Collect usability feedback and edge-case failures

Pilot recruitment
- Invite 5â€“10 refurbishers/shops and 10â€“20 individual volunteers
- Prepare pilot kit: checklists, expected outputs, consent and PII handling forms, contact for security

Pilot runbook
- Distribute agent & checklist
- Have participants run a predefined quick-mode command and upload report only if they consent
- Collect reports and annotate device metadata
- Run follow-up interviews and log issues

Launch playbook
- Finalize release notes, blog, social media post
- Provide quickstart guide and recorded demo
- Outreach to communities (r/hardware, refurbishers, local electronics markets)

---

8) RISK REGISTER & MITIGATIONS
Risk: Hardware heterogeneity causes test failures
- Mitigation: Quick-mode with graceful degradation; robust error handling & clear messaging; collect error telemetry (opt-in)

Risk: Sensitive data in artifacts
- Mitigation: Default to local storage; redact guidance & warnings; pre-upload redaction step; encrypted uploads

Risk: License choice reduces adoption
- Mitigation: Keep option to offer commercial licensing; clearly document process to request permissions

Risk: Tampering and seller fraud (faked logs)
- Mitigation: Evidence signing, video capture during stress tests, timestamped logs, bootable image option

Risk: Legal claims from report misinterpretation
- Mitigation: Strong disclaimers, "not a warranty" language, pilot terms & liability limits in LICENSE

---

9) GOVERNANCE, LEGAL & COMPLIANCE TASKS
- Maintain LICENSE.txt (custom non-commercial) and explain in README and CONTRIBUTING
- Provide a commercial licensing contact method and template for commercial requests
- Prepare data processing guidance for pilot partners (GDPR notes)
- Implement a CLA or contributor terms if required by maintainers (decide early)

---

10) BACKLOG & ISSUE HYGIENE GUIDANCE
Backlog prioritization
- P0: MVP features required for quick-mode & report.json
- P1: PDF generator, viewer, upload API
- P2: Bootable ISO scripts & memtest full flow
- P3: Windows/macOS agents, advanced features

Issue labels & templates
- Use `good first issue`, `help wanted`, `bug`, `enhancement`, `rfc`, `security`, `priority:high/medium/low`
- Maintain grooming cadence: triage weekly and assign owners
- Link issues to sprint cards on project board

Example initial issues to create now
- Agent: CLI skeleton and run command
- SMART: parse JSON and map key attributes
- Scoring: implement storage/battery/memory scoring functions with unit tests
- PDF: initial template and generator skeleton
- Bootable: write ISO builder script skeleton

---

11) POST-LAUNCH & v2 PRIORITIES (high-value ideas)
- Signed report verification tool and public key registry for marketplaces
- Windows native sensor integrations (HWiNFO / OpenHardwareMonitor)
- Model DB for expected perf baselines and auto-tuning of thresholds
- Repair cost estimator and integration with repair shops
- Image-based surface analysis (ML-assisted detection of screen cracks/scratches)
- Marketplace badges & SDK for third-party integrations (commercial option)

Prioritization criteria for v2
- Impact on buyer confidence
- Implementation complexity and risk
- Legal and privacy implications
- Potential revenue/partnership paths (for future commercialization)

---

12) HOW TO USE THIS ROADMAP (operational checklist)
- Create Sprint cards for each sprint task and assign owners + estimates.
- Create issues using the example list; break features into small PR-sized tasks.
- Enforce PR review rules and CI gates.
- Run pilot with tracked metrics and log results into an artifacts folder for retrospective.
- Review risks at each sprint retro and adjust priorities.
